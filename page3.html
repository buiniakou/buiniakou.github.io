    Brackets is an open-source editor written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a primary focus on web development. It was created by Adobe Systems, licensed under the MIT License, and is currently maintained on GitHub. Brackets is available for cross-platform download on Mac, Windows, and Linux.  
  </p>

  <p> <!-- Start normal paragraph -->
    Adobe first started development of a text editor for web development on Edge Code, which was discontinued as of November 2014. This was later transformed into Adobe Brackets. With the release of Brackets 1.0, Adobe announced that the development of an open source software for web development was ready and was not an experimental project anymore. Brackets contains more than 282 community contributors and more than 400 requests for bug fixes and new features. Every version of Brackets has more than 100,000 downloads and stands to be 16th most popular project on GitHub as of January 16, 2015.
